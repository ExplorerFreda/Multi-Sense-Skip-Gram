# NP-MSSG

Bug for NP-MSSG fixed.

the code from research paper ["Efficient Non-parametric Estimation of Multiple Embeddings per Word in Vector Space"](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.06654v1.pdf) by Arvind Neelakantan, Jeevan Shankar, Alexandre Passos, Andrew McCallum


1. the code provided by the authors of the paper. I took the code from [bitbucket account] (https://bitbucket.org/jeevan_shankar/multi-sense-skipgram/src/74aeafd22528710cd60c72d6d1d0c0edad37f567?at=master.),
2. to download the vectors trained by the provided method, follow the [link](http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/downloads/vectors/release.tar.gz), archive size is 3.3Gb
